      "taskTitle": "Project Setup with Vite, React, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup task into subtasks covering: 1) Initial Vite project creation with React and TypeScript, 2) Tailwind CSS integration and configuration, and 3) Project structure organization including folder setup and additional dependencies.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves standard project initialization steps with well-documented technologies. While it requires multiple steps, they are straightforward with clear documentation. The complexity comes from coordinating multiple technologies (Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind) rather than conceptual difficulty."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Financial Modeling Prep API Integration",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the API integration task into: 1) Setting up the API service module with environment variables, 2) Implementing data fetching functions for different endpoints, 3) Creating caching mechanism and error handling, and 4) Implementing rate limiting and loading state management.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves external API integration with complex error handling, caching logic, and rate limiting. It requires careful implementation of asynchronous operations, proper error handling for network failures, and a caching system to optimize API usage. The complexity is increased by the need to handle financial data correctly."

      "taskTitle": "Implement DCF Calculation Engine",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the DCF calculation engine implementation into: 1) Core calculation algorithm for constant growth rates, 2) Extended algorithm for year-by-year growth rates, 3) Terminal value calculation, 4) Input validation and sanitization, and 5) Utility functions for formatting and data processing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing complex financial calculations with multiple mathematical operations. It requires deep understanding of DCF methodology, careful handling of financial formulas, and robust validation to prevent calculation errors. The complexity is high due to the financial domain knowledge required and the need for mathematical precision."

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the chart visualization task into: 1) Setting up Chart.js with React integration, 2) Creating the comparison bar chart with appropriate styling and colors, and 3) Implementing responsive design and accessibility features for the charts.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires integrating Chart.js library to visualize financial data. While Chart.js simplifies the visualization process, proper configuration, styling, and ensuring the charts are responsive and accessible adds moderate complexity. The task is focused on a specific feature with clear requirements."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Theme Support with Context API",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the theme implementation into: 1) Creating the ThemeContext with light/dark mode support, 2) Implementing theme persistence with localStorage and system preference detection, and 3) Creating the theme toggle component and applying theme styles throughout the application.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves state management with Context API and theme persistence. While the concept is straightforward, proper implementation requires careful consideration of user preferences, system settings, and ensuring consistent styling throughout the application. The complexity comes from managing theme state across the entire application."

      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing comprehensive validation and error handling across the application. It involves creating custom hooks, handling various error scenarios, implementing field-specific and cross-field validation, and ensuring errors are presented in a user-friendly way. The complexity comes from the need to handle many different error cases and validation rules."

    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Detailed Growth Rate Input Option",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the detailed growth rate implementation into: 1) Creating the toggle mechanism between simple and detailed input modes, 2) Implementing the detailed year-by-year input interface with validation, and 3) Ensuring proper data conversion between the two input modes.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a dynamic form that can switch between two input modes while maintaining data integrity. It requires careful state management, proper validation for both modes, and ensuring smooth transitions between modes. The complexity comes from managing the relationship between the two input types and their validation rules."

      "reasoning": "This task involves orchestrating all components and features into a cohesive application. It requires managing complex state across multiple components, handling various application states (loading, error, results), and ensuring proper data flow. The complexity is high because it integrates all previous tasks and requires careful coordination of multiple features."
